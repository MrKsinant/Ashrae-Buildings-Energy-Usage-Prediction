# ASHRAE Buildings Energy Usage Prediction

For this project, a challenge proposed through **Kaggle** (https://www.kaggle.com) by **ASHRAE** (https://www.ashrae.org) in 2019 is going to be studied: [ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III:
How much energy will a building consume?](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction)

The goal of this challenge was to help the association to develop accurate models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electricity, hot water, and steam meters. Indeed, thankfully, significant investments are being made to improve building efficiencies to reduce costs and emissions, and, under pay-for-performance financing, building owners make payments based on the difference between their real energy consumption and what they would have used without any retrofits. Thus, with better estimates of these energy-saving actions, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest to enable progress in building efficiencies.

In this repository, you will find the following files and folders:
* The file ***ashrae-buildings-energy-usage-prediction.pdf***, the complete, detailed and explained study report, accompanied by the results obtained;
* The file *ashrae-environment.yml*, the Conda environment file, with all packages and versions, to reproduce the work performed during this project;
* The folder *graphs*, which contains all the graphs obtained during the study;
* The folder *images*, which contains the images used to illustrate the challenge (the original version of these images can be found at Kaggle's challenge presentation page-the link has been provided above);
* The folder ***notebooks***, which contains all the Jupyter notebooks used to tackle the problem exposed in the challenge;
* The folder *report*, which contains all the LaTeX sources used to produce the study report.

*Nota Bene:* Due to the weight of the files they contain, the folders *data* and *models*, mentioned in the Jupyter notebooks, are not provided here.

Finally, to conclude, respectively to the requirements, it can be said that the work performed within this study has been principally constructed around **XGBoost** (https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) and **LightGBM** (https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM), two free (and popular) software machine learning libraries.
